Abu al-Qasim al-Tanburi

Abu al-Qasim al-Tanburi was a merchant who lived in Baghdad and was known for his miserliness despite his wealth. Many anecdotes and anecdotes have been told about him, which have been widely circulated in rare literary books.

One of the most famous stories told about Abu al-Qasim al-Tanburi is the story of his shoe, which has been highlighted in more than one television series.

 The Story of Abu Qasim Al-Tanbouri's Shoe

It is said that Abu Qasim Al-Tanbouri owned an old shoe. Whenever a part of it broke, he would patch it with a piece of cloth or leather, until his shoe became full of patches and became famous among the people.

A proverb was coined about it, saying, "Heavier than Abu Qasim Al-Tanbouri's tread." Al-Tanbouri tried to get rid of it, but it caused trouble every time.

On the first attempt, Al-Tanbouri threw the shoe in the trash and bought a bottle of perfume and placed it on a shelf in his house. A man passing by the trash can saw the shoe and, thinking it was the work of a mischievous child, returned it to Al-Tanbouri's house, breaking the perfume bottle.

The second time, Al-Tanbouri threw the shoe in the river, but a fisherman brought it back to him. Al-Tanbouri placed the shoe on the roof of his house to dry, but a cat picked it up and the shoe fell on a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry. Her husband filed a complaint to the judge, who ordered Al-Tanbouri to pay blood money for the fetus and returned the shoe to him.  In another attempt, Al-Tanbouri threw the shoe into a sewer, causing it to clog and returning to him after he was punished for his actions.

He tried to bury the shoe at night, but his neighbors complained to the police, and he was imprisoned again. Finally, Al-Tanbouri went to the public bathhouse and left his shoe there. However, the prince's shoe was stolen, and Al-Tanbouri was accused of it.

Eventually, Al-Tanbouri decided to bury the shoe in the desert outside Baghdad, but he was recaptured. After his ordeal, Al-Tanbouri asked a judge to write him a deed of innocence for the shoe that had brought him trouble.

His shoe became a byword for anything ominous that is difficult to get rid of, and it was said, "Like Al-Tanbouri's shoe."
